To perform people counting using the YOLO model pretrained on the COCO dataset, you will need to install and set up the following dependencies:

A deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which will allow you to train and deploy the YOLO model.

The COCO dataset, which contains images and annotations for object detection. This dataset will be used to train and evaluate the YOLO model.

The YOLO model itself, which can be downloaded from the official YOLO website (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) or from a GitHub repository such as https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet.

OpenCV, a computer vision library that will be used to process and display the video frames and detect people in them.

Other dependencies such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy, which will be used for various tasks such as data manipulation and visualization.

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage these dependencies and avoid conflicts with other packages on your system. You can use tools such as virtualenv or conda to create and activate a virtual environment for your project.
